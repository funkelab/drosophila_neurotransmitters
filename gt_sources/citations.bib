              controlled by their compact nervous systems. Optic flow, the
              pattern of changes in the visual scene induced by locomotion, is a
              crucial sensory cue for robust self-motion estimation, especially
              during rapid flight. Neurons that respond to specific, large-field
              optic flow patterns have been studied for decades, primarily in
              large flies, such as houseflies, blowflies, and hover flies. The
              best-known optic-flow sensitive neurons are the large tangential
              cells of the dipteran lobula plate, whose visual-motion responses,
              and to a lesser extent, their morphology, have been explored using
              single-neuron neurophysiology. Most of these studies have focused
              on the large, Horizontal and Vertical System neurons, yet the
              lobula plate houses a much larger set of 'optic-flow' sensitive
              neurons, many of which have been challenging to unambiguously
              identify or to reliably target for functional studies. Here we
              report the comprehensive reconstruction and identification of the
              Lobula Plate Tangential Neurons in an Electron Microscopy (EM)
              volume of a whole Drosophila brain. This catalog of 58 LPT neurons
              (per brain hemisphere) contains many neurons that are described
              here for the first time and provides a basis for systematic
              investigation of the circuitry linking self-motion to locomotion
              control. Leveraging computational anatomy methods, we estimated
              the visual motion receptive fields of these neurons and compared
              their tuning to the visual consequence of body rotations and
              translational movements. We also matched these neurons, in most
              cases on a one-for-one basis, to stochastically labeled cells in
              genetic driver lines, to the mirror-symmetric neurons in the same
              EM brain volume, and to neurons in an additional EM data set.
              Using cell matches across data sets, we analyzed the integration
              of optic flow patterns by neurons downstream of the LPTs and find
              that most central brain neurons establish sharper selectivity for
              global optic flow patterns than their input neurons. Furthermore,
              we found that self-motion information extracted from optic flow is
              processed in distinct regions of the central brain, pointing to
              diverse foci for the generation of visual behaviors.",

               female will make during her lifetime. A female fly signals her
               willingness to mate by opening her vaginal plates, allowing a
               courting male to copulate1,2. Vaginal plate opening (VPO) occurs
               in response to the male courtship song and is dependent on the
               mating status of the female. How these exteroceptive (song) and
               interoceptive (mating status) inputs are integrated to regulate
               VPO remains unknown. Here we characterize the neural circuitry

               Drosophila melanogaster. We show that VPO is controlled by a pair
               of female-specific descending neurons (vpoDNs). The vpoDNs
               receive excitatory input from auditory neurons (vpoENs), which
               are tuned to specific features of the D. melanogaster song, and
               from pC1 neurons, which encode the mating status of the
               female3,4. The song responses of vpoDNs, but not vpoENs, are
               attenuated upon mating, accounting for the reduced receptivity of
               mated females. This modulation is mediated by pC1 neurons. The
               vpoDNs thus directly integrate the external and internal signals

               sensory responsiveness and endogenously generated behaviors.
               Biogenic amines have been determined to be causal factors for
               these states of arousal. It is well established that, in
               Drosophila, dopamine and octopamine promote increased arousal.
               However, little is known about factors that regulate arousal
               negatively and induce states of quiescence. Moreover, it remains
               unclear whether global, diffuse modulatory systems
               comprehensively affecting brain activity determine general states
               of arousal. Alternatively, individual aminergic neurons might
               selectively modulate the animals' activity in a distinct
               behavioral context. Here, we show that artificially activating
               large populations of serotonin-releasing neurons induces
               behavioral quiescence and inhibits feeding and mating. We
               systematically narrowed down a role of serotonin in inhibiting
               endogenously generated locomotor activity to neurons located in
               the posterior medial protocerebrum. We identified neurons of this
               cell cluster that suppress mating, but not feeding behavior.
               These results suggest that serotonin does not uniformly act as
               global, negative modulator of general arousal. Rather, distinct
               serotoninergic neurons can act as inhibitory modulators of
               specific behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: An animal's
               responsiveness to external stimuli and its various types of
               endogenously generated, motivated behavior are highly dynamic and
               change between states of high activity and states of low
               activity. It remains unclear whether these states are mediated by
               unitary modulatory systems globally affecting brain activity, or
               whether distinct neurons modulate specific neuronal circuits
               underlying particular types of behavior. Using the model organism
               Drosophila melanogaster, we find that activating large
               proportions of serotonin-releasing neurons induces behavioral
               quiescence. Moreover, distinct serotonin-releasing neurons that
               we genetically isolated and identified negatively affect aspects
               of mating behavior, but not food uptake. This demonstrates that
               individual serotoninergic neurons can modulate distinct types of
               behavior selectively.",

              Flylight Gal4 lines by driving expression of the gene coding for
              the temperature sensitive dTRPA1 channel, yielded a single line
              (GMR26E01-Gal4) displaying greatly enhanced aggression when

              throughout male and female nervous systems, but the enhanced
              aggression was seen only in females. No effects were seen on

              animals. The success of these efforts relies on the experimenter's
              ability to target arbitrarily small subsets of neurons for
              manipulation, but such specificity of targeting cannot routinely
              be achieved using existing methods. In Drosophila melanogaster, a
              widely-used technique for refined cell type-specific manipulation
              is the Split GAL4 system, which augments the targeting specificity
              of the binary GAL4-UAS (Upstream Activating Sequence) system by
              making GAL4 transcriptional activity contingent upon two
              enhancers, rather than one. To permit more refined targeting, we
              introduce here the ``Killer Zipper'' (KZip+), a suppressor that

              acts by disrupting both the formation and activity of Split GAL4

               copulation. Here we identify the neural circuitry that links egg
               laying to mating status in Drosophila melanogaster. Activation of
               female-specific oviposition descending neurons (oviDNs) is
               necessary and sufficient for egg laying, and is equally potent in

               from the male seminal fluid-triggers many behavioural and
               physiological changes in the female, including the onset of egg
               laying1. Sex peptide is detected by sensory neurons in the

               types-T4 and T5-are the first known relay neurons to signal
               small-field direction-selective motion responses [1]. These cells
               then feed into large tangential cells that signal wide-field
               motion. Recent studies have identified two types of columnar
               neurons in the second neuropil, or medulla, that relay input to
               T4 from L1, the ON-channel neuron in the first neuropil, or
               lamina, thus providing a candidate substrate for the elementary
               motion detector (EMD) [2]. Interneurons relaying the OFF channel
               from L1's partner, L2, to T5 are so far not known, however.
               RESULTS: Here we report that multiple types of transmedulla (Tm)
               neurons provide unexpectedly complex inputs to T5 at their
               terminals in the third neuropil, or lobula. From the L2 pathway,
               single-column input comes from Tm1 and Tm2 and multiple-column
               input from Tm4 cells. Additional input to T5 comes from Tm9, the
               medulla target of a third lamina interneuron, L3, providing a
               candidate substrate for L3's combinatorial action with L2 [3].
               Most numerous, Tm2 and Tm9's input synapses are spatially
               segregated on T5's dendritic arbor, providing candidate
               anatomical substrates for the two arms of a T5 EMD circuit; Tm1
               and Tm2 provide a second. Transcript profiling indicates that T5
               expresses both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinoceptors,
               qualifying T5 to receive cholinergic inputs from Tm9 and Tm2,
               which both express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). CONCLUSIONS:
               We hypothesize that T5 computes small-field motion signals by
               integrating multiple cholinergic Tm inputs using nicotinic and
               muscarinic cholinoceptors.",

               or functional perspective without reference to how the circuits

               candidate pathways for ON- and OFF-edge motion detection in the

               T5, two cell types of the fourth neuropil, or lobula plate (LOP),

              roles in aggression in a wide variety of animals. Previous
              investigations of 5HT function in adult Drosophila behavior have
              relied on pharmacological manipulations, or on combinations of
              genetic tools that simultaneously target both DA and 5HT neurons.
              Here, we generated a transgenic line that allows selective, direct
              manipulation of serotonergic neurons and asked whether DA and 5HT
              have separable effects on aggression. Quantitative morphological
              examination demonstrated that our newly generated tryptophan
              hydroxylase (TRH)-Gal4 driver line was highly selective for
              5HT-containing neurons. This line was used in conjunction with
              already available Gal4 driver lines that target DA or both DA and
              5HT neurons to acutely alter the function of aminergic systems.
              First, we showed that acute impairment of DA and 5HT
              neurotransmission using expression of a temperature sensitive form
              of dynamin completely abolished mid- and high-level aggression.
              These flies did not escalate fights beyond brief low-intensity
              interactions and therefore did not yield dominance relationships.
              We showed next that manipulation of either 5HT or DA
              neurotransmission failed to duplicate this phenotype. Selective
              disruption of 5HT neurotransmission yielded flies that fought, but
              with reduced ability to escalate fights, leading to fewer
              dominance relationships. Acute activation of 5HT neurons using
              temperature sensitive dTrpA1 channel expression, in contrast,
              resulted in flies that escalated fights faster and that fought at
              higher intensities. Finally, acute disruption of DA
              neurotransmission produced hyperactive flies that moved faster
              than controls, and rarely engaged in any social interactions. By
              separately manipulating 5HT- and DA- neuron systems, we collected
              evidence demonstrating a direct role for 5HT in the escalation of
              aggression in Drosophila.",

              mammalian sleep. Characteristic rhythms are associated with
              different sleep stages and variable levels of sleep pressure, but
              it remains unclear whether these oscillations are passive mirrors
              or active generators of sleep. Here we report that sleep-control
              neurons innervating the dorsal fan-shaped body ofDrosophila(dFBNs)
              produce slow-wave activity (SWA) in the delta frequency band
              (0.2–1 Hz) that is causally linked to sleep. The dFBN ensemble
              contains one or two rhythmic cells per hemisphere whose membrane
              voltages oscillate in anti-phase between hyperpolarized DOWN and
              depolarized UP states releasing bursts of action potentials. The
              oscillations rely on direct interhemispheric competition of two
              inhibitory half-centres connected by glutamatergic synapses.
              Interference with glutamate release from these synapses disrupts
              SWA and baseline as well as rebound sleep, while the optogenetic
              replay of SWA (with the help of an intersectional, dFBN-restricted
              driver) induces sleep. Rhythmic dFBNs generate SWA throughout the
              sleep–wake cycle—despite a mutually antagonistic ‘flip-flop’
              arrangement with arousing dopaminergic neurons—but adjust its
              power to sleep need via an interplay of sleep history-dependent
              increases in dFBN excitability and homeostatic depression of their
              efferent synapses, as we demonstrate transcriptionally,
              structurally, functionally, and with a simple computational model.
              The oscillatory format permits a durable encoding of sleep
              pressure over long time scales but requires downstream mechanisms
              that convert the amplitude-modulated periodic signal into binary

              (Refinetti and Menaker, 1992) and decreases during the night,
              which is associated with sleep initiation (Gilbert et al., 2004;
              Kräuchi, 2007a,b). However, the underlying mechanism of this
              temperature decrease is largely unknown. We have previously shown
              that Drosophila exhibit a daily temperature preference rhythm
              (TPR), in which their preferred temperatures increase during the
              daytime and then decrease at the transition from day to night
              (night-onset) (Kaneko et al., 2012). Because Drosophila are small
              ectotherms, their body temperature is very close to that of the
              ambient temperature (Stevenson, 1985), suggesting that their TPR
              generates their body temperature rhythm. Here, we demonstrate that
              the neuropeptide diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) and pigment-dispersing
              factor receptor (PDFR) contribute to regulate the preferred
              temperature decrease at night-onset. We show that PDFR and
              tethered-DH31 expression in dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s) restore the
              preferred temperature decrease at night-onset, suggesting that
              DH31 acts on PDFR in DN2s. Notably, we previously showed that the
              molecular clock in DN2s is important for TPR. Although PDF
              (another ligand of PDFR) is a critical factor for locomotor
              activity rhythms, Pdf mutants exhibit normal preferred temperature
              decreases at night-onset. This suggests that DH31-PDFR signaling
              specifically regulates a preferred temperature decrease at
              night-onset. Thus, we propose that night-onset TPR and locomotor
              activity rhythms are differentially controlled not only by clock
              neurons but also by neuropeptide signaling in the brain.
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Body temperature rhythm (BTR) is
              fundamental for the maintenance of functions essential for
              homeostasis, such as generating metabolic energy and sleep. One
              major unsolved question is how body temperature decreases
              dramatically during the night. Previously, we demonstrated that a
              BTR-like mechanism, referred to as temperature preference rhythm
              (TPR), exists in Drosophila Here, we demonstrate that the diuretic
              hormone 31 (DH31) neuropeptide and pigment-dispersing factor
              receptor (PDFR) regulate preferred temperature decreases at
              night-onset via dorsal neurons 2. This is the first in vivo
              evidence that DH31 could function as a ligand of PDFR. Although
              both DH31 and PDF are ligands of PDFR, we show that DH31 regulates
              night-onset TPR, but PDF does not, suggesting that night-onset TPR
              and locomotor activity rhythms are controlled by different
              neuropeptides via different clock cells.",

               states, such as the transition from arousal to sleep. However,
               the neural mechanisms by which time and environmental conditions
               promote these behavioral transitions are poorly defined. Here, we
               show that the E1 subclass of Drosophila evening clock neurons
               promotes the transition from arousal to sleep at dusk. We first
               demonstrate that the cell-autonomous clocks of E2 neurons
               primarily drive and adjust the phase of evening anticipation, the
               canonical behavior associated with ``evening'' clock neurons. We
               next show that conditionally silencing E1 neurons causes a
               significant delay in sleep onset after dusk. However, rather than
               simply promoting sleep, activating E1 neurons produces time- and
               light-dependent effects on behavior. Activation of E1 neurons has
               no effect early in the day but then triggers arousal before dusk
               and induces sleep after dusk. Strikingly, these
               activation-induced phenotypes depend on the presence of light
               during the day. Despite their influence on behavior around dusk,
               in vivo voltage imaging of E1 neurons reveals that their spiking
               rate and pattern do not significantly change throughout the day.
               Moreover, E1-specific clock ablation has no effect on arousal or
               sleep. Thus, we suggest that, rather than specifying ``evening''
               time, E1 neurons act, in concert with other rhythmic neurons, to
               promote behavioral transitions at dusk.",

               the successive expression of temporal transcription factors

               the complete series of tTFs that specify most Drosophila optic

               known about the neural or molecular basis underlying the
               integration of these processes. D. melanogaster potently suppress
               sleep in response to starvation, and powerful genetic tools allow
               for mechanistic investigation of sleep-metabolism interactions.
               We have previously identified neurons expressing the neuropeptide
               leucokinin (Lk) as being required for starvation-mediated changes
               in sleep. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for Lk
               neuropeptide in metabolic regulation of sleep. The activity of Lk
               neurons is modulated by feeding, with reduced activity in
               response to glucose and increased activity under starvation
               conditions. Both genetic silencing and laser-mediated
               microablation localize Lk-dependent sleep regulation to a single
               pair of Lk neurons within the Lateral Horn (LHLK neurons). A
               targeted screen identified a role for 5' adenosine
               monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in
               starvation-modulated changes in sleep. Knockdown of AMPK in Lk
               neurons suppresses sleep and increases LHLK neuron activity in
               fed flies, phenocopying the starvation state. Further, we find a
               requirement for the Lk receptor in the insulin-producing cells
               (IPCs), suggesting LHLK-IPC connectivity is critical for sleep
               regulation under starved conditions. Taken together, these

               a single pair of neurons within the fruit fly brain and provide a

              behaviors. RESULTS To assemble this map, we deconstructed the
              adult Drosophila brain into approximately 16,000 single neurons
              and reconstructed them into a common standardized framework to
              produce a virtual fly brain. We have constructed a mesoscopic map
              and found that it consists of 41 local processing units (LPUs),
              six hubs, and 58 tracts covering the whole Drosophila brain.
              Despite individual local variation, the architecture of the

              signals are referenced to the body, but ultimately, they must be
              transformed into world-centric coordinates for navigation1,2. Here
              we show that this computation occurs in the fan-shaped body in the
              brain of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify two cell types, PFNd
              and PFNv3-5, that conjunctively encode translational velocity and
              heading as a fly walks. In these cells, velocity signals are
              acquired from locomotor brain regions6 and are multiplied with
              heading signals from the compass system. PFNd neurons prefer
              forward-ipsilateral movement, whereas PFNv neurons prefer
              backward-contralateral movement, and perturbing PFNd neurons
              disrupts idiothetic path integration in walking flies7.

               sets of neurons that commonly constitute a small fraction of the
               total number of neurons. However, some neuropeptide genes are
               expressed in larger numbers of neurons of diverse types
               suggesting that they are involved in a greater diversity of
               functions. One of these widely expressed genes, snpf, encodes the
               precursor of short neuropeptide F (sNPF). To unravel possible
               functional diversity we have mapped the distribution of
               transcript of the snpf gene and its peptide products in the
               central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila in relation to other
               neuronal markers. RESULTS: There are several hundreds of neurons
               in the larval CNS and several thousands in the adult Drosophila
               brain expressing snpf transcript and sNPF peptide. Most of these
               neurons are intrinsic interneurons of the mushroom bodies.
               Additionally, sNPF is expressed in numerous small interneurons of
               the CNS, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of the antennae, and
               in a small set of possibly neurosecretory cells innervating the
               corpora cardiaca and aorta. A sNPF-Gal4 line confirms most of the
               expression pattern. None of the sNPF immunoreactive neurons
               co-express a marker for the transcription factor DIMMED,
               suggesting that the majority are not neurosecretory cells or
               large interneurons involved in episodic bulk transmission.
               Instead a portion of the sNPF producing neurons co-express
               markers for classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine,
               GABA and glutamate, suggesting that sNPF is a co-transmitter or
               local neuromodulator in ORNs and many interneurons.
               Interestingly, sNPF is coexpressed both with presumed excitatory
               and inhibitory neurotransmitters. A few sNPF expressing neurons
               in the brain colocalize the peptide corazonin and a pair of
               dorsal neurons in the first abdominal neuromere coexpresses sNPF
               and insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7). CONCLUSION: It is likely that
               sNPF has multiple functions as neurohormone as well as local
               neuromodulator/co-transmitter in various CNS circuits, including
               olfactory circuits both at the level of the first synapse and at
               the mushroom body output level. Some of the sNPF immunoreactive
               axons terminate in close proximity to neurosecretory cells
               producing ILPs and adipokinetic hormone, indicating that sNPF
               also might regulate hormone production or release.",

               of behavioral rhythms for the ion transport peptide (ITP), which
               is expressed in the fifth small ventral lateral neuron, one
               dorsal lateral neuron, and in only a few nonclock cells in the
               brain. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that ITP, like PDF,
               is most probably released in a rhythmic manner at projection
               terminals in the dorsal protocerebrum. This rhythm continues
               under constant dark conditions, indicating that ITP release is
               clock controlled. ITP expression is reduced in the hypomorph
               mutant Clk(AR), suggesting that ITP expression is regulated by
               CLOCK. Using a genetically encoded RNAi construct, we knocked
               down ITP in the two clock cells and found that these flies show
               reduced evening activity and increased nocturnal activity.
               Overexpression of ITP with two independent timeless-GAL4 lines
               completely disrupted behavioral rhythms, but only slightly
               dampened PER cycling in important pacemaker neurons, suggesting a
               role for ITP in clock output pathways rather than in the
               communication within the clock network. Simultaneous knockdown
               (KD) of ITP and PDF made the flies hyperactive and almost
               completely arrhythmic under constant conditions. Under light-dark
               conditions, the double-KD combined the behavioral characteristics
               of the single-KD flies. In addition, it reduced the flies' sleep.
               We conclude that ITP and PDF are the clock's main output signals
               that cooperate in controlling the flies' activity rhythms.",

               a drastic reduction in transcriptional amplitude, resulting in a
               reduction in mRNA production of the target gene. We provide
               evidence of synergy, such that multiple binding sites with
               moderate affinities cooperatively recruit more TFs to drive
               stronger transcriptional activity than a single site. Moreover, a
               Hidden Markov-based stochastic model of transcription reveals
               that embryos with mutated binding sites have a higher probability
               of returning to the inactive promoter state. We propose that
               TF-DNA binding regulates spatial and temporal gene expression and
               drives robust pattern formation by modulating transcriptional
               kinetics and tuning bursting rates.",

              that in animals as distant as flies and humans, visual regions

               circadian processes, which interact to determine sleep timing and
               duration, but the mechanisms through which the circadian system
               modulates sleep are largely unknown. We therefore used
               adult-specific, temporally controlled neuronal activation and
               inhibition to identify an interaction between the circadian clock
               and a novel population of sleep-promoting neurons in Drosophila.
               METHODS: Transgenic flies expressed either dTRPA1, a neuronal
               activator, or Shibire(ts1), an inhibitor of synaptic release, in
               small subsets of neurons. Sleep, as determined by activity
               monitoring and video tracking, was assessed before and after
               temperature-induced activation or inhibition using these effector
               molecules. We compared the effect of these manipulations in
               control flies and in mutant flies that lacked components of the
               molecular circadian clock. RESULTS: Adult-specific activation or
               inhibition of a population of neurons that projects to the
               sleep-promoting dorsal Fan-Shaped Body resulted in bidirectional
               control over sleep. Interestingly, the magnitude of the sleep
               changes were time-of-day dependent. Activation of sleep-promoting
               neurons was maximally effective during the middle of the day and
               night, and was relatively ineffective during the day-to-night and
               night-to-day transitions. These time-ofday specific effects were
               absent in flies that lacked functional circadian clocks.
               CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the circadian system functions to
               gate sleep through active inhibition at specific times of day.
               These data identify a mechanism through which the circadian
               system prevents premature sleep onset in the late evening, when
               homeostatic sleep drive is high.",

               was largely attributed to dietary cysteine intake.
               Mechanistically, dietary cysteine increased the production of a
               neuropeptide FMRFamide (FMRFa). Enhanced FMRFa activity
               simultaneously promoted energy expenditure and suppressed food
               intake through its cognate receptor (FMRFaR), both contributing
               to the fat loss effect. In the fat body, FMRFa signaling promoted
               lipolysis by increasing PKA and lipase activity. In sweet-sensing
               gustatory neurons, FMRFa signaling suppressed appetitive

              models, the exact function or functions of sleep remain(s)
              unknown. A complicating factor in trying to elucidate the function
              of sleep is the complexity and multiplicity of neuronal circuits
              that are involved in sleep regulation. It is conceivable that
              distinct sleep-regulating circuits are only involved in specific
              aspects of sleep and may underlie different sleep functions. Thus,
              it would be beneficial to assess the contribution of individual
              circuits in sleep putative functions. The intricacy of the
              mammalian brain makes this task extremely difficult. However, the
              fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, with its simpler brain
              organization, available connectomics, and unparalleled genetics
              offers the opportunity to interrogate individual sleep-regulating
              centers. In Drosophila, neurons projecting to the dorsal
              Fan-Shaped Body (dFB) have been proposed to be key regulators of
              sleep, particularly sleep homeostasis. We recently demonstrated
              that the most widely used genetic tool to manipulate dFB neurons,
              the 23E10-GAL4 driver, expresses in two sleep-regulating neurons
              (VNC-SP neurons) located in the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC), the fly
              analog of the vertebrate spinal cord. Since most data supporting a
              role for the dFB in sleep regulation have been obtained using
              23E10-GAL4, it is unclear whether the sleep phenotypes reported in
              these studies are caused by dFB neurons or VNC-SP cells. A recent
              publication replicated our finding that 23E10-GAL4 contains
              sleep-promoting neurons in the VNC. However, it also proposed that
              the dFB is not involved in sleep regulation at all, but this
              suggestion was made using genetic tools that are not dFB-specific
              and a very mild sleep deprivation protocol. In this study, using a
              newly created dFB-specific genetic driver line, we demonstrate
              that the majority of 23E10-GAL4 dFB neurons can promote sleep when
              activated and that these neurons are involved in sleep
              homeostasis. We also show that dFB neurons require stronger
              stimulation than VNC-SP cells to promote sleep. In addition, we
              demonstrate that dFB-induced sleep can consolidate Short-Term
              Memory (STM) into Long-Term Memory (LTM), suggesting that the
              benefit of sleep on memory is not circuit-specific. Finally, we
              show that dFB neurons are neurochemically heterogeneous and can be
              divided in 3 populations. Most dFB neurons express both glutamate
              and acetylcholine, while a minority of cells express only one of
              these two neurotransmitters. Importantly, dFB neurons do not
              express GABA, as previously suggested. Using
              neurotransmitter-specific dFB tools, our data also points at
              cholinergic dFB neurons as particularly potent at regulating sleep

               mechanisms that regulate these two aspects have not been fully
               elucidated in Drosophila. Diminished signaling with insulin-like

               intake in flies, but it is not clear what signal(s) mediates
               satiety. Here we investigate the role of DILPs and drosulfakinins
               (DSKs), cholecystokinin-like peptides, as satiety signals in
               Drosophila. We show that DSKs and DILPs are co-expressed in
               insulin-producing cells (IPCs) of the brain. Next we analyzed the
               effects of diminishing DSKs or DILPs employing the Gal4-UAS
               system by (1) diminishing DSK-levels without directly affecting
               DILP levels by targeted Dsk-RNAi, either in all DSK-producing
               cells (DPCs) or only in the IPCs or (2) expressing a
               hyperpolarizing potassium channel to inactivate either all the

               resistance to starvation, and for levels of Dilp and Dsk
               transcripts in brains of fed and starved animals. Diminishment of
               DSK in the IPCs alone is sufficient to cause defective regulation
               of food intake and food choice, indicating that DSK functions as
               a hormonal satiety signal in Drosophila. Quantification of Dsk
               and Dilp transcript levels reveals that knockdown of either
               peptide type affects the transcript levels of the other,
               suggesting a possible feedback regulation between the two
               signaling pathways. In summary, DSK and DILPs released from the

              Identification of neurons providing inputs to multiple NSC
              subtypes implicates diuretic hormone 44-expressing NSC as a major
              coordinator of physiology and behavior. Surprisingly, despite most

              We also deciphered pathways via which diverse olfactory inputs are

              from descending neurons to NSC, suggesting that descending neurons

              remains poorly understood. Studies in Drosophila larvae have
              yielded information about neuropeptides and circuits that promote
              feeding, but a peptidergic neuron subset whose activation inhibits
              feeding in adult flies, without promoting metabolic changes that
              mimic the state of satiety, has not been identified. Using
              genetically based manipulations of neuronal activity, we show that
              activation of neurons (or neuroendocrine cells) expressing the
              neuropeptide allatostatin A (AstA) inhibits or limits several
              starvation-induced changes in feeding behavior in adult
              Drosophila, including increased food intake and enhanced
              behavioral responsiveness to sugar. Importantly, these effects on
              feeding behavior are observed in the absence of any measurable
              effects on metabolism or energy reserves, suggesting that AstA
              neuron activation is likely a consequence, not a cause, of
              metabolic changes that induce the state of satiety. These data

               Drosophila, four neurons called the interoceptive subesophageal
               zone neurons (ISNs) respond to intrinsic hunger and thirst
               signals to oppositely regulate sucrose and water ingestion. Here,

               Utilizing the recently available fly brain connectome, we find

               neuron (BiT) that projects to neuroendocrine centers. In vivo

              the elementary motion detector circuit (EMD; [4, 5]), compares
              visual signals from neighboring photoreceptors to derive
              information on motion direction and velocity. This information is
              fed by two types of interneuron, L1 and L2, in the first optic

              fly, Drosophila melanogaster, including α-synuclein-induced
              degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, or dopamine (DA) loss by

              L-DOPA, analogous to the treatment paradigm for PD. Secondary
              complication from L-DOPA treatment in PD patients are associated
              with ectopic synthesis of DA in serotonin (5-HT)-releasing

              research in flies has clarified how neural circuits extract
              information from moving visual scenes. However, the major pathways
              connecting these patterns of optic flow to behavior remain poorly
              understood. Using a high-throughput quantitative assay of visually
              guided behaviors and genetic neuronal silencing, we discovered a
              region inDrosophila’s protocerebrum critical for visual motion
              following. We used neuronal silencing, calcium imaging, and
              optogenetics to identify a single cell type, LPC1, that innervates
              this region, detects translational optic flow, and plays a key
              role in regulating forward walking. Moreover, the population of
              LPC1s can estimate the travelling direction, such as when gaze
              direction diverges from body heading. By linking specific cell
              types and their visual computations to specific behaviors, our
              findings establish a foundation for understanding how the nervous
              system uses vision to guide navigation.",

               its metabolic rate and arresting its reproduction. Here, we show
               that a subset of dorsal neurons (DN3s) that express the
               neuropeptide allatostatin C (AstC) facilitates recovery from
               cold-induced reproductive dormancy. The activity of
               AstC-expressing DN3s, as well as AstC peptide levels, are

              behavior. Local ACh application, or direct Kenyon cell activation,
              evokes activity in mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). MBON
              activation depends on VAChT expression in Kenyon cells and is
              blocked by ACh receptor antagonism. Furthermore, reducing
              nicotinic ACh receptor subunit expression in MBONs compromises
              odor-evoked activation and redirects odor-driven behavior. Lastly,

               served by the amine in aggression have been difficult to define
               because dopaminergic systems influence many behaviors, and all
               can be altered by changing the function of dopaminergic neurons.
               In the fruit fly, with the powerful genetic tools available,
               small subsets of brain cells can be reliably manipulated,
               offering enormous advantages for exploration of how and where
               amine neurons fit into the circuits involved with aggression. By
               combining the GAL4/upstream activating sequence (UAS) binary
               system with the Flippase (FLP) recombination technique, we were
               able to restrict the numbers of targeted DA neurons down to a
               single-cell level. To explore the function of these individual
               dopaminergic neurons, we inactivated them with the tetanus toxin

               release, or activated them with dTrpA1, a temperature-sensitive

               subtypes, respectively. These data suggest that the two types of
               dopaminergic neurons may influence aggression through
               interactions in the central complex region of the brain involving
               two different DA receptor subtypes.",
