It is glutamatergic and also expresses Nplp1 (IPNamide) and CCHamide1 (Shafer et al., 2006; Collins et al., 2012; Fujiwara et al., 2018; Reinhard et al., 2022). It arborizes ipsilaterally in the ventromedial posterior lateral horn and the lateral and dorsal mushroom body accessory calyces with mixed pre- and post-synaptic terminals (Bates et al., 2020; Marin et al., 2020; Reinhard et al., 2022). A ventral projection extends to the posterior optic commissure and follows it laterally, reaching the accessory medulla, where it has mainly presynaptic terminals (Bates et al., 2020; Marin et al., 2020; Reinhard et al., 2022). A large amount of input is from the thermosensory VP3 vPN and VP2 adPN neurons (Marin et al., 2020; Alpert et al., 2020). Activity of the cold-responsive VP3 vPN has a strong inhibitory effect on DN1a (Alpert et al., 2020). There are two of these cells per hemisphere and they are primary neurons (Shafer et al., 2006; Bates et al., 2020). One of these cells per hemisphere additionally extends a branch dorsally into the SLP (Reinhard et al., 2022).""}]"
