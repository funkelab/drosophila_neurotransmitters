# Drosophila Neurotransmitters

This repository contains data on neurotransmitters emitted by cell type in Drosophila Melanogaster. 
It is stored in the form of a CSV file with version control through GitHub PRs.

## How to change data
1. Download the `data.csv` file and open with your favorite spreadsheet reader.
2. Add your data to the bottom of the `data.csv` file, and save **as a CSV**.
3. Return to this page and click on the plus sign next to `Code`. You should see a dropdown menu, choose `Upload Files`.
4. Upload your version of the `data.csv` file you modified. Make sure that it has the same name!
5. Fill in the form below.
    - Change `Add files via upload` to a more precise description of your changes. Keep it short and simple! 
    - Add more detail into the `Add an optional extended description...` form field below it.
6. Click on `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`. You can keep the branch name that comes up by default.
7. You will be brought to a `Open a pull request` page. Review your changes and click on `Create pull request` once you're done.
8. Wait for review from one of the maintainers! You may be asked follow-up questions to make sure your added data matches with our expectations, so please be patient.

## How to change data (but I know how to use Git)
Clone this repository and create a new branch.
Modify the data file, commit with a meaningful name and push.
Create a PR for your branch once you're happy with it.
